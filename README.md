# Showcase site

This is a showcase site for my own personal projects. It will be live at
[https://www.grantramsay.dev][grdev]

Currently very plain and basic, but I intend to add carousels and other fancy
stuff in time.

## Stack

Written completely in ReactJS, pulling data from a local file for each project.
It also uses the GitHub GraphQL service to pull metadata (number of commits,
stars, watchers, open Pull Requests etc etc) for each project if appliciable.
The project is full responsive and mobile-friendly.
