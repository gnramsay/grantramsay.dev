# Showcase site

This is a showcase site for my own personal projects. It will be live at
[https://www.grantramsay.dev][grdev]

Currently very plain and basic, but I intend to add carousels and other fancy
stuff in time.

## Stack

Written completely in ReactJS, pulling data from a local file for each project.
It will also pull repo details from Github for each project if appliciable. The
project is full responsive and mobile-friendly.
